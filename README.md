# Hashcode2019

Ideas:
- we better use as much slides/pictures as possible
- Calculate the score of every transition (might be difficult with vertical pictures)
- at most, one slide may be found in 2 transitions
- we can select the transitions with the max score and that with at most
- some pictures may have the same tags (reduce complexity)
